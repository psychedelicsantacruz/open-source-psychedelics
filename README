Welcome to Open Source Psychedelics.

This is a repository for collecting code, resources, protocols, forms and other technologies to support the safe use of Psychedelics for the human species evolutionary process of healing, growth and transformation.

Contents stored here may be the base for other projects. Our intention is to share all of this through a Creative Commons license: CC-BY-SA-NC 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

Our intention is to also build a community around these resources, such that psychonauts, practitioners and other related entities may discuss the utility and shape of the shared resources.

Our first phase will run from May 2024 through December 2024 and will focus on:

1. Connecting with other people, contributors and actors in the Open Source Psychedelics space
2. Collecting resources that are already in the public domain
3. Categorizing the information into subsets or subprojects
4. Establishing initial projects, goals and milestones for 2025
